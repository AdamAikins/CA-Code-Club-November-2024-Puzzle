# What To Do With This Template

## As a Problemsetter

Write your program in Main.java. 

This program should read from stdin and write to stdout. 

The program should have two parts, the obfusticated method, and a part that will check the result of this method. 

The obfusticated method should take in input from stdin and produce some result.

Note: The obfusticated method may call other methods.

Make sure it is clear what the desired output from the method is.

For solver convenience, print the output of the method after it is called.

## As a Solver

### Compile Main

First compile Main.java.

If you are using BlueJ, hit the compile button.

If you are using another program, you probably know what to do.

If you want to compile from the terminal, navigate to the right folder and use
```
javac Main.java
```

### Run Main

After you finish compiling, run Main.

If you are using BlueJ, run Tester.main() with no arguments as so:
```
Tester.main({});
```

If you are using another program, you (again) probably already know what to do.

If you want to run from the terminal, use
```
java Tester
```

### Give program input

Then, give the program input from stdin.

If you are using BlueJ, a window should pop up to let you type in input.

If you are using another program, ... you probably know what to do.

If you are using the terminal, just type your input in and press enter.

### Check if the output was correct

The problem setter should have tested whether the output from the obfusticated method was correct. 

If this is so, you will see the output from the obfusticated method after it operated on your input, and then you will see if it was the desired result.
